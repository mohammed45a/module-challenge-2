# Portfolio Challenge - Module 2

## Description
In this challenge, the task was to build a portfolio page for previous and future projects. I enjoyed this project because it allowed me to personalise the page a little. I was able to add some of my own photos as backgrounds for some of the elements. I used Flexible box layout, grid layout and media queries. I'm still getting the hang of it as I found it quite difficult but I'm happy with the outcome. Once again, MORE PRACTICE NEEDED!
